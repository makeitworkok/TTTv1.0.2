# 🚀 Platform Testing Update 🚀

We’re currently putting the **Radxa Zero 3e** through its paces as a potential platform of choice for this project!  
It’s looking promising, but we want to make sure it meets all our needs—so expect plenty of tinkering and testing before we make anything official.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to push the limits! 🛠️🔬

**Interested in helping out with testing?**  
I’d love some extra hands (and hardware!) on deck. If you’re curious or want to help, please reach out!
